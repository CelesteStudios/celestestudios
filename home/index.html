                Why oh why, I have been asking myself that question for many years,
                to be honest with you I'm not quite certain, oh the fates may have intertwined now,
                I don't fathom this concept of chance, why now, what changed? What's going to change? 正直わからないよ！
                <br>
                じゃ、それでいいです、そろそろ戻るよ！
                <br>
                That was fun, let's do it again!
