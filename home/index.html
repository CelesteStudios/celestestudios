                    <h3>What is Celeste Studios?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Celeste Studios is a multi-function website,
                        the intent is to create a website that offers multiple services such as,
                        Web Development, Software Services, Ads Management services, Social Media Management,
                        and a lot more, the site is also intended to act as a portfolio for myself "Khalid (Axel) Idris".

                    <p>
                        My name is Khalid Idris (Axel), I'm a Software Engineer / Web Developer who has
                        experience in a lot of fields and I want to showcase my skills and offer my services,
                        They're primarily freelancing stuff at the moment but I wouldn't mind joining a company
                        and working full time, Celeste Studios will always be my own thing, my own tiny company,
                        If it grows one day into something big that would be great, but It's sort of a passion project at the moment.
